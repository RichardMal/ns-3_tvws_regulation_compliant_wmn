olsr-with-dsa is based on the original olsr that ships with NS3.

For simplicity, before making any changes, I maintain the original module and then to create my modified version I simply rename every file in olsr by inserting "with-dsa" after"olsr" in the file name.

I have not touched test, examples folder, these were create by the ./create-module-script
